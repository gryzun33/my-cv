        Hello. I'm Olga. I've been studying vanilla JavaScript for quite some time, currently
        immersed in learning React, Next.js and all the supporting libraries. My strengths are
        responsibility, communication skills, attention to detail. In my previous life I worked as
        an electrical design engineer for power supply and lighting, but during maternity leave I
        decided to try my hand at programming.
